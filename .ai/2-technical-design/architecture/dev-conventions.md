# Development Conventions

## Naming Conventions
- **Camel Case**: Use camelCase for variable and function names (e.g., `myVariable`, `calculateTotal`).
- **Snake Case**: Use snake_case for file names and constants (e.g., `my_file_name.py`, `MAX_RETRIES`).

## Indentation
- **Spaces vs. Tabs**: Use spaces for indentation.
- **Indentation Size**: Use 4 spaces per indentation level.

## Code Formatting
- **Line Length**: Limit lines to 80 characters.
- **Braces**: Use braces for all control structures, even if they are optional.
- **Whitespace**: Use a single blank line to separate logical sections of the code.

## Commenting
- **Inline Comments**: Use inline comments sparingly and only when the code is not self-explanatory.
- **Block Comments**: Use block comments to describe the overall purpose of a code block.
- **Documentation Comments**: Use docstrings for documenting modules, classes, and functions.

## Version Control
- **Branch Naming**: Use descriptive names for branches (e.g., `feature/add-login`, `bugfix/fix-crash`).
- **Commit Messages**: Write clear and concise commit messages. Use the imperative mood (e.g., `Add login feature`, `Fix crash on startup`).

## Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for all functions and methods.
- **Integration Tests**: Write integration tests for critical workflows.
- **Test Coverage**: Aim for at least 80% test coverage.

## Linting and Building
- **Linting**: Use a linter to enforce coding standards (e.g., ESLint for JavaScript, Pylint for Python).
- **Build Process**: Automate the build process using tools like Make, Gradle, or npm scripts.
- **Continuous Integration**: Use CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment.

## Code Reviews
- **Pull Requests**: Submit pull requests for all changes.
- **Review Process**: Ensure at least one other developer reviews the code before merging.
- **Feedback**: Provide constructive feedback and be open to receiving it.

## Documentation
- **Code Documentation**: Document all public APIs and complex logic.
- **README Files**: Include a README file in each repository with setup instructions and usage examples.
- **Changelog**: Maintain a changelog to document changes and updates.

## Security Practices
- **Sensitive Data**: Avoid hardcoding sensitive data in the codebase. Use environment variables or secrets management tools.
- **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities.
- **Dependency Management**: Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.

## Performance Optimization
- **Profiling**: Use profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks.
- **Caching**: Implement caching strategies to improve performance.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Use asynchronous processing for I/O-bound tasks.

## Error Handling
- **Exceptions**: Use exceptions for error handling. Provide meaningful error messages.
- **Logging**: Implement logging to capture and diagnose errors. Use different log levels (e.g., INFO, WARN, ERROR).

## Collaboration
- **Communication**: Use project management and communication tools (e.g., Jira, Slack) to coordinate work.
- **Meetings**: Hold regular meetings to discuss progress, blockers, and next steps.
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Share knowledge through documentation, code reviews, and team discussions.
