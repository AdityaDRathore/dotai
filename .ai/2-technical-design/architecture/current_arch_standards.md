## Components

### Authentication (Auth)
Handles user authentication and authorization processes. Ensures secure access to the application by verifying user credentials and managing user sessions.

### Middleware
Acts as an intermediary layer that processes requests and responses. It can handle tasks such as logging, authentication, error handling, and request parsing before passing control to the next component.

### Storage
Manages data persistence and retrieval. This includes databases, file storage systems, and caching mechanisms to ensure data is stored securely and can be accessed efficiently.

### User Interface (UI)
Responsible for the visual and interactive aspects of the application. It includes components such as forms, buttons, and navigation elements that users interact with.

### API Gateway
Serves as a single entry point for client requests, routing them to the appropriate backend services. It can also handle tasks such as rate limiting, authentication, and load balancing.

### Notification System
Manages the delivery of notifications to users. This can include email notifications, push notifications, and in-app alerts to keep users informed about important events and updates.

### Logging and Monitoring
Tracks application performance and logs important events. This helps in identifying issues, monitoring system health, and ensuring the application runs smoothly.
