# Scalability Requirements

## Scalability Strategy
- Support horizontal scaling for stateless services
- Vertical scaling for database systems
- Auto-scaling based on CPU utilization (60-80% threshold)

## Traffic Patterns
- Handle sustained traffic of 10,000 RPM (requests per minute)
- Peak traffic handling of 50,000 RPM for 30-minute durations
- Daily traffic fluctuations between 20%-150% of baseline

## Data Volume Estimates
- Initial dataset: 500 GB
- Monthly growth: 50 GB
- Maximum concurrent connections: 10,000

## Scaling Benchmarks
| Component        | Baseline | Max Scale | Scaling Trigger         |
|-------------------|----------|-----------|-------------------------|
| API Servers       | 4 nodes  | 32 nodes  | CPU >75% for 5 minutes  |
| Database          | 1 cluster| 3 clusters| Query latency >500ms    |
| Cache Layer       | 8 nodes  | 24 nodes  | Cache miss rate >25%    |

## Scalability Testing
- Quarterly load testing simulating 2x expected peak load
- Failure scenario testing for database failover (max 5 minute recovery time)
- Progressive scaling tests with 10% weekly traffic increases
