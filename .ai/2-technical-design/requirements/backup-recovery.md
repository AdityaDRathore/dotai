# Backup and Recovery Strategies

## Overview
This document outlines the backup and recovery strategies to ensure data integrity, availability, and resilience in case of data loss or system failure. It includes details on retention periods, Recovery Time Objective (RTO), and Recovery Point Objective (RPO).

## Backup Strategies
- **Full Backups**: Complete backup of all data. Typically performed weekly.
- **Incremental Backups**: Backup of data that has changed since the last backup. Performed daily.
- **Differential Backups**: Backup of data that has changed since the last full backup. Performed mid-week.

## Retention Periods
- **Daily Backups**: Retained for 30 days.
- **Weekly Backups**: Retained for 6 months.
- **Monthly Backups**: Retained for 1 year.
- **Annual Backups**: Retained for 7 years.

## Recovery Objectives
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: The maximum acceptable amount of time to restore data and resume normal operations after a disruption. Our RTO is 4 hours.
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: The maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time. Our RPO is 1 hour.

## Backup Storage
- **On-Premises Storage**: Local storage for quick access and recovery.
- **Offsite Storage**: Remote storage to protect against local disasters.
- **Cloud Storage**: Cloud-based storage for scalability and redundancy.

## Testing and Validation
- **Regular Testing**: Perform regular backup and recovery tests to ensure data can be restored successfully.
- **Validation**: Validate the integrity and completeness of backups.

## Compliance and Security
- **Encryption**: Encrypt backups both in transit and at rest.
- **Access Control**: Implement strict access controls to protect backup data.
- **Compliance**: Ensure backup and recovery processes comply with relevant regulations and standards.

## Monitoring and Maintenance
- **Monitoring**: Continuously monitor backup processes and storage health.
- **Maintenance**: Regularly update and maintain backup systems and software.

## Incident Response
- **Response Plan**: Establish a clear incident response plan for data recovery.
- **Roles and Responsibilities**: Define roles and responsibilities for backup and recovery tasks.

## Documentation
- **Backup Procedures**: Document detailed backup procedures and schedules.
- **Recovery Procedures**: Document step-by-step recovery procedures.
