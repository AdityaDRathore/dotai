# Performance Requirements

## Response Time Goals
| Service                 | P50   | P95   | P99   |
|-------------------------|-------|-------|-------|
| API Response Time       | 200ms | 500ms | 1000ms|
| Data Processing Latency | 500ms | 2s    | 5s    |
| Cache Hit Response      | 10ms  | 25ms  | 50ms  |

## Throughput Requirements
- Minimum: 1,000 requests/second sustained
- Peak: 5,000 requests/second for 15-minute bursts
- Data ingestion: 500 MB/second per node

## Resource Utilization Limits
| Resource  | Warning Threshold | Critical Threshold |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------------|
| CPU       | 70%               | 90%                |
| Memory    | 75%               | 90%                |
| Disk I/O  | 60%               | 80%                |

## Performance Testing
- Load testing with 2x expected peak traffic weekly
- Stress testing to failure point monthly
- Continuous performance monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana
