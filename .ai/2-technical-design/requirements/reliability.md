# Reliability Requirements

## System Reliability Targets
- 99.99% uptime for core messaging services
- Maximum 5 minutes MTTR (Mean Time To Recovery)
- <50ms message delivery latency for 95% of messages

## Redundancy Requirements
- Active-active deployment across 3 availability zones
- Hot standby database replicas with <1s replication lag
- Message queue replication to secondary region with 5-minute synchronization

## Failure Handling
| Failure Scenario       | Detection Timeout | Recovery Procedure              |
|-------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| Node Failure            | 30 seconds        | Automatic traffic rerouting     |
| Database Outage         | 15 seconds        | Failover to standby replica     |
| Network Partition       | 60 seconds        | Circuit breaker activation      |
| Service Degradation     | 90 seconds        | Auto-scaling triggered           |

## Disaster Recovery
- RPO (Recovery Point Objective): 5 minutes
- RTO (Recovery Time Objective): 15 minutes
- Quarterly disaster recovery drills required

## Reliability Testing
- Monthly chaos engineering tests
- Simulated failure scenarios:
  - Regional outage failover
  - Database corruption recovery
  - Network latency spikes
