## Status
Current status: Approved
Version: 1.0.0
Last updated: 2025-03-01

## Scope
This standard applies to all public-facing web services, APIs, and applications within the project.

## Requirements

1. Protocol Support
   - MUST support TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3
   - MUST NOT support SSL 3.0, TLS 1.0, or TLS 1.1
   - SHOULD prefer TLS 1.3 when available
   
2. Certificate Requirements
   - MUST use certificates signed by a trusted CA
   - MUST use certificates with at least 2048-bit RSA keys or 256-bit ECC keys
   - MUST use certificates with SHA-256 or stronger signature algorithms
   - MUST include appropriate SAN (Subject Alternative Name) entries
   - SHOULD implement certificate transparency
   
3. Cipher Suites
   - MUST only support strong cipher suites with forward secrecy
   - MUST disable weak ciphers (RC4, DES, 3DES, etc.)
   - SHOULD follow Mozilla's "Modern" or "Intermediate" cipher suite recommendations
   
4. HTTP Security Headers
   - MUST implement HSTS with a minimum max-age of 180 days
   - SHOULD implement HSTS preloading
   - SHOULD implement OCSP stapling

## Validation
Compliance with this standard is validated through:
- Automated scanning using SSLyze during CI/CD pipeline
- Quarterly manual verification using Qualys SSL Server Test
- Documentation in compliance_reports/security/

## Exceptions
- Internal development environments may use self-signed certificates
- Legacy systems scheduled for retirement within 6 months may be granted temporary exceptions
