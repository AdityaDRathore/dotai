## Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for Managing Stale Documentation in LLMs and Finding and Validating New Libraries

### Managing Stale Documentation
1. **Regular Review**:
   - Schedule periodic reviews of all documentation related to libraries used in LLMs.
   - Assign team members to check for outdated information and mark it for updates.

2. **Using Brave MCP**:
   - Utilize Brave MCP to search for the latest documentation and updates for libraries.
   - Ensure that the libraries have a significant number of GitHub stars, indicating community trust and activity.

3. **Updating Documentation**:
   - Download the latest documentation using Brave MCP.
   - Integrate the updated information into the working knowledge base.
   - Archive the old documentation with version control for reference.

4. **Validation**:
   - Cross-check the updated documentation with official sources and community feedback.
   - Validate the changes through testing and ensure compatibility with existing systems.

### Finding and Validating New Libraries
1. **Library Search**:
   - Use Brave MCP to search for new libraries that meet the project requirements.
   - Prioritize libraries with high GitHub star ratings and active maintenance.

2. **Initial Assessment**:
   - Review the library's documentation, community support, and recent activity.
   - Check for any known issues or limitations that may affect the project.

3. **Testing and Integration**:
   - Download the library and conduct initial tests to evaluate its functionality and performance.
   - Integrate the library into a sandbox environment to assess compatibility with existing systems.

4. **Documentation and Knowledge Base Update**:
   - Document the findings and integration steps for the new library.
   - Update the working knowledge base with the new library's documentation and usage guidelines.

5. **Continuous Monitoring**:
   - Monitor the library for updates and community feedback.
   - Schedule regular reviews to ensure the library remains up-to-date and continues to meet project requirements.
